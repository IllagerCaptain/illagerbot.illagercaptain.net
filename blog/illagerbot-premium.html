  <h2>IllagerBot Premium</h2>
  <p>IllagerBot is a Discord moderation bot, but it also has some other useful features unrelated to moderation. However, like almost everything, hosting is not free. IllagerBot Premium will be a monthly payment which will support IllagerBot's development. For your support, you will get access to some exclusive features. These features will only <i>extentions</i> of existing features. For example, <b>/poll</b> allows you to post polls that one can vote yes or no to. With IllagerBot Premium, maybe you could have a poll that has options like favorite food or inputting the reason for your vote. This is just an example of what kind of things would be behind Premium, the exact features will be added as new features are added.</p>
  <p>Until Premium is added, any Premium features will be available via Server Boosting, and when Premium is added, any booster will be grandfathered and continue to get access to Premium features until they stop boosting.</p>
